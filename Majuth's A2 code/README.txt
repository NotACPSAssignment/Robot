Compile using standard OpenGL in windows environment using visual studio code 
as prof instructed.

My project satisifes all full 12 marks for the assignment with no bonuses done.

Use "a" to animate the object across the spline. Use "r" to move object back to start positon.

Use "w" to change to wheel (default), it also spins around as needed by the assignment.
Use "s" to change to the sphere.
Use "c" to switch the cube/rectangle thing needed.

Interactive zoom in/out can be done by dragging and sliding up and down in the 3Dwindow
as the prof demonstrated in his example video.

Defensive cannon can be slid left and right using the left and right arrow keys.
